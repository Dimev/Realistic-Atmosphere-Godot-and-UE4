This resporitory provides code for adding realistic admospheres to godot and unreal engine 4.
The size, color and intensity can all be tuned.

For unreal engine 4, a project including all needed assets is given (for version 4.22.3)
For godot, a standalone shader file is given, as well as a demo project

### usage
The UE4 and Godot versions are used a bit differently, so I've created a seperate guide for them
usage guides are here:
[Godot](usage/godot.md) 

[UE4](usage/ue4.md)

The shadertoy verion can be found [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wlBXWK), also by me.

The code is based on the [implementation by scratchapixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/procedural-generation-virtual-worlds/simulating-sky), with a few modifications to make it work from space, and to make it look nicer

### license
The assets are shared under the MIT license, more detail in the LICENSE file.

If you use this in a game or other software, I'm fine with being credited with "Atmosphere by Dimas Leenman, Shared under the MIT license" somewhere in the credits.
